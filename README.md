# Depth First Search Project
This project is an extension of my **Pathfinding Project**. It use **Depth First Search (DFS)** algorithm to generate mazes, which I will use it as as dynamically generated maps in my game later.

## Overview
- Depth First Search maze Algorithm to create a maze
- Randomly placing the finish point between the 2nd and 5th backtrack step.
- Custom grid-based wall and path visualization for real-time maze generation.
- A* Algorithm for pathfinding

## Note
- I use this project and the Pathfinding project as an experiment for version control using Git and learning Java, so it may not be perfect or fully optimized.
